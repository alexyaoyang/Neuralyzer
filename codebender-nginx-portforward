# This file just sets up a port forward for nginx to the Symfony's server
# Port 80 is usually taken up by apache or whatever builtin web server is running, so we are using port 8080 as the external port
# And we are routing that to port 8000, which is the default port for Symfony's server:run command
# This way we can expose Symfony's server to the host computer easily
